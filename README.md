# Embedded Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step journey into embedded systems with STM32 microcontrollers.  
Each project has its own folder and README with details.

## Roadmap
- Week 1 â€“ GPIO Button + LED
- Week 2 â€“ Timer & PWM
- Week 3 â€“ UART Communication
- Week 4 â€“ ADC Sensor Read
- Week 5 â€“ I2C / SPI with Sensors
- Week 6 â€“ SD Card Data Logger
- Week 7 â€“ FreeRTOS Basics
- Week 8 â€“ CAN Bus Communication
- Week 9 â€“ RS485 & Modbus
- Week 10 â€“ IoT Data Logger (Final Project)

## About
The purpose of this repository is to create a **portfolio of embedded projects** while learning STM32 development.  
Each week adds new concepts, from simple GPIO to real-time operating systems and IoT connectivity.
